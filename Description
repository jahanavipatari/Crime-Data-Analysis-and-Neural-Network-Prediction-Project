Crime Data Analysis and Neural Network Prediction Project

Introduction
This project aims to analyze crime patterns and predict future crime occurrences using historical crime data from 2018 to 2024. 
The dataset, sourced from the Cityâ€™s official data platform, provides monthly records of reported crimes across various neighborhoods. 
By exploring trends within this data, a neural network model is developed and optimized to generate crime forecasts.

Approach
The project follows a structured methodology:

Data Acquisition and Inspection: Importing the dataset and reviewing its structure to understand the variables and content.
Preprocessing: Cleaning the data by handling missing values, ensuring consistency, and transforming variables where necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying key trends, seasonal variations, and community-specific crime patterns.
Model Development: Implementing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for time-series prediction.
Optimization and Training: Fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve accuracy and generalization.
Crime Forecasting: Utilizing the trained model to predict future crime occurrences.
Findings from Data Exploration
The analysis uncovered several significant crime patterns:

Crime Distribution by Community:

Certain communities exhibited higher crime rates, with Beltline, Forest Lawn, and Downtown Commercial Core being the most affected.
Some areas had significantly lower crime rates, including community 13M, which accounted for a large share of the least reported crimes.
Crime Categories:

The most frequently reported crimes were Theft from Vehicle, Theft of Vehicle, and Commercial Break and Enter.
Crime types varied across neighborhoods, with some areas showing specific crime hotspots.
Trends Over Time:

The highest number of crimes was reported in 2019, followed by 2022 and 2018.
The dataset for 2024 was incomplete, containing data for only a few months.
Seasonal trends indicated fluctuations in crime rates across different months.
Community and Crime Type Correlation:

Certain communities were linked to specific crime types, such as a high incidence of break-ins in Forest Lawn.
Yearly Trends Across Categories:

Shifts in crime categories over the years highlighted evolving patterns in criminal activities.
Neural Network Model for Crime Prediction
To forecast future crime occurrences, an LSTM-based neural network was designed and trained. LSTM models are well-suited for time-series forecasting due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies.

Model Development and Training Process:

Data Preparation: Converting the dataset into sequences suitable for time-series modeling.
Train-Test Split: Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets for performance evaluation.
Model Architecture:
LSTM layer with 50 units to capture sequential dependencies.
Dropout layer to prevent overfitting.
Dense output layer for final predictions.
Compilation and Optimization:
Adam optimizer used for efficient learning.
Mean Squared Error (MSE) employed as the loss function.
Training: Model trained for 100 epochs with validation to monitor performance.
Performance and Insights
The model demonstrated a steady decrease in loss, indicating improved accuracy in crime predictions.
Validation loss suggested reliable generalization to unseen data.
The forecasting capability of the model provides valuable insights for law enforcement and policymakers to allocate resources effectively.
Conclusion
This project successfully combined data analysis and machine learning to study crime trends and forecast future incidents.
By leveraging an LSTM-based predictive model, crime occurrences can be anticipated, allowing for proactive safety measures and better resource planning. 
The findings provide valuable insights that can support data-driven decision-making in public safety and crime prevention
